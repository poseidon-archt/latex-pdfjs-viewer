[![CI](https://github.com/xtenzQ/cv/actions/workflows/blank.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/xtenzQ/cv/actions/workflows/blank.yml) [![pages-build-deployment](https://github.com/xtenzQ/cv/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/xtenzQ/cv/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment)

Builds LaTeX doc into PDF and then publishes it on GitHub pages so we can now embed our PDF with the following link:
```
https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/<filename>.pdf
```

That's my CV btw.
